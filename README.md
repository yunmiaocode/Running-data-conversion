Convert Huawei running data (json) to gpx file

1.Project motivation: Many Huawei sports watch (bracelet) users are confused about how to upload previous data to other platforms (such as Garmin/Gochi) 
after changing the device. This project can convert the json![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b20b865-7eb2-4fe8-be90-05ee4dd46f8b) file provided by Huawei account into gpx file

2.Project results: Generate multiple gpx files

4.Project issues:
(1) Can only be converted into gpx files;
(2) Can only recognize running data

5.Project expectations:
(1) Establish a standardized sports data format;
(2) Allow people who do not understand programming to easily inherit their own sports data;
(3) Record the basic data collected by the equipment, do not care about the brand's derivative algorithms, and establish a large data model to better reflect the athlete's exercise status.
